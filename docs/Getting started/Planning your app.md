# Planning your app

You want to build a Jigx App but where do you start, and how do you build an app that fulfills your users' expectations and engages them every time they open it?  It all starts with planning, not just planning what it will look like but also planning the building and testing of the app. In this section, we guide you on how to plan your Jigx App from beginning to end. Creating a good plan makes building an app easier and faster; you may skip or combine some of these steps or even order them differently, which is fine; these steps aim to help you know what to think about before building your app.

## Checklist

Here is a checklist of the high-level steps when planning your app:

- [ ] [ Identify the solution requirements](<./Planning your app/Solution Requirements.md>)
- [ ] [Plan the solution design ](<./Planning your app/Solution Design.md>)
- [ ] [Home screen](<./Planning your app/Home screen.md>)
- [ ] [Data planning](<./Planning your app/Data planning.md>)
- [ ] [Build the App](<./Planning your app/Building the app.md>)
- [ ] [Test plan](<./Planning your app/Testing Plan.md>)
- [ ] [Post App launch](<./Planning your app/Post App launch.md>)

## Example

As you will learn in this section, a series of plans go into creating an app. We suggest logically linking flowcharts, mind maps, entity relationship diagrams, and wireframes. This helps the creator and stakeholders walk through the entire app concept and know exactly how elements are going to work. Below is an example of a Pizza Store App plan created in Miro.
